            <p>Print advertising offers advertisers a high level of control and flexibility. Advertisers can determine when and where their advertisement will appear with relative precision. For example, an advertisement for a kitchen appliance can appear in a woman's magazine or weekend supplement to a daily paper. Advertisers can also control the number of insertions. For high frequency, they can run a series of related advertisements and for low frequency, they can run the ad fewer times.
